In video games, some characters can _drop_ items or experience points on the ground for the player to pick up. These items and points are commonly referred to as drops.

In Level Up XP, drops are shortcodes (e.g. `[xpdrop abcdef]`) that an instructor can place in regular Moodle content. When encountered by a user, these drops will be _picked up_ and a certain amount of points will be awarded.

At present, drops are invisible to the user and passively award points the first time they are encountered.

Drops can be used to cleverly award points when certain type of content is consumed by a student. Here are some ideas:

- Place a drop in the feedback of a quiz only visible for perfect scores
- Place a drop in deep content to reward their consumption
- Place a drop in an interesting forum discussion
- Place a drop in a hard-to-get-to page in a lesson module

Points are never taken away from students, and negative grades are ignored.

Example: Alice submits an assignment, and receives the mark of 40/100. In _Level Up XP_, Alice receives 40 points for her grade.
Alice reattempts her assignment, but this time her grade is lowered to 25/100. Alice\'s points in _Level Up XP_ do not change.
For her final attempt, Alice scores 60/100, she earns 20 additional points in _Level Up XP_, her total of points earned is 60.

A link to the full leaderboard will automatically be displayed below the table, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

Refer to the examples below to format this shortcode. When a level is strictly specified, the content will be displayed regardless of the other rules.

Note that teachers, or otherwise users with editing capabilities, will always see everything.
