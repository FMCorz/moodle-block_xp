/**
 * Welcome to the future of Moodle plugin!
 *
 * Just kidding, but isn't it much nicer to have routing? I am not
 * pretending to have designed the best API. In fact I did not try,
 * there really is not point trying to do better than many of the
 * existing libraries. But copying a whole library in this plugin
 * is just not worth it.
 *
 * Moodle core should support routing and other niceties for any
 * developer to use. Oh, and when I say 'support', I don't mean
 * rewriting a new routing engine...
